      "\u001b[42mIt is that promise that has always set this country apart â€” that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[47mThat's why I stand here tonight.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[42mBecause for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women â€” students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors â€” found the courage to keep it alive.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[41mWe meet at one of those defining moments â€” a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.\u001b[0m\n",
