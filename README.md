Table of contents:
1. Initial data preprocessing
2. Normal vs actual distribution of feature components for each species
3. Machine Learning models optimization and evaluation. I use `GridSearchCV` for optimization of hyperparameters. 
4. Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and TruncatedSVD
    4.1. Prediction of the species of the test sample using these algorithms
5. Spliting the data to train, test and validation segments
6. Optimizing the hyperparameters
7. Fitting and predicting Speed and Score Comparison for all algorithms
8. Correlation map function definition
9. Metrics
    1. Precision score
        1. Averaged
        3. Individual
    2. Accuracy score
    3. Recall score
10. Classification report
11. Confusion matrix for all models
12. Normalized confusion matrix for all models
