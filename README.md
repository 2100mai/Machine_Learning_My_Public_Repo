# Machine Learning using scikit-learn. 

Table of contents:
1. Initial data preprocessing
2. Normal vs actual distribution of feature components for each species
3. Univariable and bivariable kernel density plots
4. Machine Learning models optimization and evaluation. I use `GridSearchCV` for optimization of hyperparameters. 
5. Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
6. Spliting the data to train, test and validation segments
7. Optimizing the hyperparameters
8. Correlation map function definition
9. Metrics
    1. Precision score
        1. Averaged
        3. Individual
    2. Accuracy score
    3. Recall score
10. Classification report
11. Confusion matrix for all models
12. Normalized confusion matrix for all models
